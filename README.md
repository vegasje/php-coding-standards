Coding Standard
=====================

This section of the standard comprises what should be considered the standard
coding elements that are required to ensure a high level of technical
interoperability between shared PHP code.

1. Overview
-----------

- Files MUST use only `<?php` tags for class files.

- Files MUST use only `<?` and `<?=` tags for output files.

- Files MUST use only UTF-8 without BOM for PHP code.

- Files SHOULD *either* declare symbols (classes, functions, constants, etc.)
  *or* cause side-effects (e.g. generate output, change .ini settings, etc.)
  but SHOULD NOT do both.

- Namespaces and classes MUST follow an "autoloading" PSR: [[PSR-0], [PSR-4]].

- Class names MUST be declared in `StudlyCaps`.

- Class constants MUST be declared in all upper case with underscore separators.

- Method names MUST be declared in `camelCase`.

- Code MUST use tabs for indenting, not spaces. Spaces are used to align after indentation.

- There MUST be one blank line after the `namespace` declaration, and there
  MUST be one blank line after the block of `use` declarations.

- Opening braces for classes MUST go on the next line, and closing braces MUST
  go on the next line after the body.

- Opening braces for methods MUST go on the next line, and closing braces MUST
  go on the next line after the body.

- Visibility MUST be declared on all properties and methods; `abstract` and
  `final` MUST be declared before the visibility; `static` MUST be declared
  after the visibility.
  
- Control structure keywords MUST have one space after them; method and
  function calls MUST NOT.

- Opening braces for control structures MUST go on the same line, and closing
  braces MUST go on the next line after the body.

- Opening parentheses for control structures MUST NOT have a space after them,
  and closing parentheses for control structures MUST NOT have a space before.

### 1.1. Example

This example encompasses some of the rules below as a quick overview:

```php
<?php namespace Vendor\Package;

use FooInterface;
use BarClass as Bar;
use OtherVendor\OtherPackage\BazClass;

class Foo extends Bar implements FooInterface
{
    public function sampleFunction($a, $b=null)
    {
        if ($a === $b) {
            bar();
        } elseif ($a > $b) {
            $foo->bar($arg1);
        } else {
            BazClass::bar($arg2, $arg3);
        }
    }

    final public static function bar()
    {
        // method body
    }
}
```

2. Files
--------

### 2.1. PHP Tags

Files MUST use only `<?php` tags for class files.
Files MUST use only `<?` and `<?=` tags for output files.

### 2.2. Character Encoding

PHP code MUST use only UTF-8 without BOM.

### 2.3. Side Effects

A file SHOULD declare new symbols (classes, functions, constants,
etc.) and cause no other side effects, or it SHOULD execute logic with side
effects, but SHOULD NOT do both.

The phrase "side effects" means execution of logic not directly related to
declaring classes, functions, constants, etc., *merely from including the
file*.

"Side effects" include but are not limited to: generating output, explicit
use of `require` or `include`, connecting to external services, modifying ini
settings, emitting errors or exceptions, modifying global or static variables,
reading from or writing to a file, and so on.

The following is an example of a file with both declarations and side effects;
i.e, an example of what to avoid:

```php
<?php
// side effect: change ini settings
ini_set('error_reporting', E_ALL);

// side effect: loads a file
include "file.php";

// side effect: generates output
echo "<html>\n";

// declaration
function foo()
{
    // function body
}
```

The following example is of a file that contains declarations without side
effects; i.e., an example of what to emulate:

```php
<?php
// declaration
function foo()
{
    // function body
}

// conditional declaration is *not* a side effect
if (!function_exists('bar')) {
    function bar()
    {
        // function body
    }
}
```


3. Namespace and Class Names
----------------------------

Namespaces and classes MUST follow an "autoloading" PSR: [[PSR-0], [PSR-4]].

This means each class is in a file by itself, and is in a namespace of at
least one level: a top-level vendor name.

Class names MUST be declared in `StudlyCaps`.

Code written for PHP 5.3 and after MUST use formal namespaces.

For example:

```php
<?php namespace Vendor\Model;

class Foo
{
}
```

4. Class Constants, Properties, and Methods
-------------------------------------------

The term "class" refers to all classes, interfaces, and traits.

### 4.1. Constants

Class constants MUST be declared in all upper case with underscore separators.
For example:

```php
<?php namespace Vendor\Model;

class Foo
{
    const VERSION = '1.0';
    const DATE_APPROVED = '2012-06-01';
}
```

### 4.2. Properties

This guide intentionally avoids any recommendation regarding the use of
`$StudlyCaps`, `$camelCase`, or `$under_score` property names.

Whatever naming convention is used SHOULD be applied consistently within a
reasonable scope. That scope may be vendor-level, package-level, class-level,
or method-level.

### 4.3. Methods

Method names MUST be declared in `camelCase()`.



5. General Styling
------------------

### 5.1 Files

All PHP files MUST use the Unix LF (linefeed) line ending.

All PHP files MUST end with a single blank line.

The closing `?>` tag MUST be omitted from files containing only PHP.

### 5.2. Indenting

Code MUST use tabs for indenting. Spaces should be used to further refine alignment after indentation.

For example:

```php
<?php namespace Vendor\Model;

class Foo
{
    // Spaces can be used inside code lines to align code contents.
    // Spaces should never be used to indent lines.
    const VERSION       = '1.0';
    const DATE_APPROVED = '2012-06-01';
}
```

### 5.3. Keywords and True/False/Null

PHP [keywords] MUST be in lower case.

The PHP constants `true`, `false`, and `null` MUST be in lower case.

[keywords]: http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.keywords.php



6. Namespace and Use Declarations
---------------------------------

When present, there MUST be one blank line after the `namespace` declaration.

When present, all `use` declarations MUST go after the `namespace`
declaration.

There MUST be one `use` keyword per declaration.

There MUST be one blank line after the `use` block.

For example:

```php
<?php namespace Vendor\Package;

use FooClass;
use BarClass as Bar;
use OtherVendor\OtherPackage\BazClass;

// ... additional PHP code ...

```


7. Classes, Properties, and Methods
-----------------------------------

The term "class" refers to all classes, interfaces, and traits.

### 7.1. Extends and Implements

The `extends` and `implements` keywords MUST be declared on the same line as
the class name.

The opening brace for the class MUST go on its own line; the closing brace
for the class MUST go on the next line after the body.

```php
<?php namespace Vendor\Package;

use FooClass;
use BarClass as Bar;
use OtherVendor\OtherPackage\BazClass;

class ClassName extends ParentClass implements \ArrayAccess, \Countable
{
    // constants, properties, methods
}
```

Lists of `implements` MAY be split across multiple lines, where each
subsequent line is indented once. When doing so, the first item in the list
MUST be on the next line, and there MUST be only one interface per line.

```php
<?php namespace Vendor\Package;

use FooClass;
use BarClass as Bar;
use OtherVendor\OtherPackage\BazClass;

class ClassName extends ParentClass implements
    \ArrayAccess,
    \Countable,
    \Serializable
{
    // constants, properties, methods
}
```

### 7.2. Properties

Visibility MUST be declared on all properties.

The `var` keyword MUST NOT be used to declare a property.

There MUST NOT be more than one property declared per statement.

Property names SHOULD NOT be prefixed with a single underscore to indicate
protected or private visibility.

A property declaration looks like the following.

```php
<?php namespace Vendor\Package;

class ClassName
{
    public $foo = null;
}
```

### 7.3. Methods

Visibility MUST be declared on all methods.

Method names SHOULD NOT be prefixed with a single underscore to indicate
protected or private visibility.

Method names MUST NOT be declared with a space after the method name. The
opening brace MUST go on its own line, and the closing brace MUST go on the
next line following the body. There MUST NOT be a space after the opening
parenthesis, and there MUST NOT be a space before the closing parenthesis.

A method declaration looks like the following. Note the placement of
parentheses, commas, spaces, and braces:

```php
<?php namespace Vendor\Package;

class ClassName
{
    public function fooBarBaz($arg1, &$arg2, $arg3=[])
    {
        // method body
    }
}
```    

### 7.4. Method Arguments

In the argument list, there MUST NOT be a space before each comma, and there
MUST be one space after each comma.

Method arguments with default values MUST go at the end of the argument
list.

Method arguments with default values should not place spaces between the argument
name, the equals symbol, and the value.

```php
<?php namespace Vendor\Package;

class ClassName
{
    public function foo($arg1, &$arg2, $arg3=[])
    {
        // method body
    }
}
```

Argument lists MAY be split across multiple lines, where each subsequent line
is indented once. When doing so, the first item in the list MUST be on the
next line, and there MUST be only one argument per line.

When the argument list is split across multiple lines, the closing parenthesis
and opening brace MUST be placed together on their own line with one space
between them.

```php
<?php namespace Vendor\Package;

class ClassName
{
    public function aVeryLongMethodName(
        ClassTypeHint $arg1,
        &$arg2,
        array $arg3=[]
    ) {
        // method body
    }
}
```

### 7.5. `abstract`, `final`, and `static`

When present, the `abstract` and `final` declarations MUST precede the
visibility declaration.

When present, the `static` declaration MUST come after the visibility
declaration.

```php
<?php namespace Vendor\Package;

abstract class ClassName
{
    protected static $foo;

    abstract protected function zim();

    final public static function bar()
    {
        // method body
    }
}
```

### 7.6. Method and Function Calls

When making a method or function call, there MUST NOT be a space between the
method or function name and the opening parenthesis, there MUST NOT be a space
after the opening parenthesis, and there MUST NOT be a space before the
closing parenthesis. In the argument list, there MUST NOT be a space before
each comma, and there MUST be one space after each comma.

```php
<?php
bar();
$foo->bar($arg1);
Foo::bar($arg2, $arg3);
```

Argument lists MAY be split across multiple lines, where each subsequent line
is indented once. When doing so, the first item in the list MUST be on the
next line, and there MUST be only one argument per line.

```php
<?php
$foo->bar(
    $longArgument,
    $longerArgument,
    $muchLongerArgument
);
```

8. Control Structures
---------------------

The general style rules for control structures are as follows:

- There MUST be one space after the control structure keyword
- There MUST NOT be a space after the opening parenthesis
- There MUST NOT be a space before the closing parenthesis
- There MUST be one space between the closing parenthesis and the opening
  brace
- The structure body MUST be indented once
- The closing brace MUST be on the next line after the body

The body of each structure MUST be enclosed by braces. This standardizes how
the structures look, and reduces the likelihood of introducing errors as new
lines get added to the body.


### 8.1. `if`, `elseif`, `else`

An `if` structure looks like the following. Note the placement of parentheses,
spaces, and braces; and that `else` and `elseif` are on the same line as the
closing brace from the earlier body.

```php
<?php
if ($expr1) {
    // if body
} elseif ($expr2) {
    // elseif body
} else {
    // else body;
}
```

The keyword `elseif` SHOULD be used instead of `else if` so that all control
keywords look like single words.


### 8.2. `switch`, `case`

A `switch` structure looks like the following. Note the placement of
parentheses, spaces, and braces. The `case` statement MUST NOT be indented
from `switch`, and the `break` keyword (or other terminating keyword) MUST be
indented at the same level as the `case` body. There MUST be a comment such as
`// no break` when fall-through is intentional in a non-empty `case` body.

```php
<?php
switch ($expr) {
case 0:
    echo 'First case, with a break';
    break;
case 1:
    echo 'Second case, which falls through';
    // no break
case 2:
case 3:
case 4:
    echo 'Third case, return instead of break';
    return;
default:
    echo 'Default case';
    break;
}
```


### 8.3. `while`, `do while`

A `while` statement looks like the following. Note the placement of
parentheses, spaces, and braces.

```php
<?php
while ($expr) {
    // structure body
}
```

Similarly, a `do while` statement looks like the following. Note the placement
of parentheses, spaces, and braces.

```php
<?php
do {
    // structure body;
} while ($expr);
```

`while` and `do while` statements should be used only when absolutely necessary.
When given a choice, prefer a limited loop construct, such as `for` or `foreach`.

### 8.4. `for`

A `for` statement looks like the following. Note the placement of parentheses,
spaces, and braces.

```php
<?php
for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
    // for body
}
```

### 8.5. `foreach`
    
A `foreach` statement looks like the following. Note the placement of
parentheses, spaces, and braces. There should not be spaces between the
key, `=>`, and value sections of the `foreach`.

```php
<?php
foreach ($iterable as $key=>$value) {
    // foreach body
}
```

### 8.6. `try`, `catch`

A `try catch` block looks like the following. Note the placement of
parentheses, spaces, and braces.

```php
<?php
try {
    // try body
} catch (FirstExceptionType $e) {
    // catch body
} catch (OtherExceptionType $e) {
    // catch body
}
```

9. Closures
-----------

Closures MUST be declared with a space after the `function` keyword, and a
space before and after the `use` keyword.

The opening brace MUST go on the same line, and the closing brace MUST go on
the next line following the body.

There MUST NOT be a space after the opening parenthesis of the argument list
or variable list, and there MUST NOT be a space before the closing parenthesis
of the argument list or variable list.

In the argument list and variable list, there MUST NOT be a space before each
comma, and there MUST be one space after each comma.

Closure arguments with default values MUST go at the end of the argument
list.

A closure declaration looks like the following. Note the placement of
parentheses, commas, spaces, and braces:

```php
<?php
$closureWithArgs = function ($arg1, $arg2) {
    // body
};

$closureWithArgsAndVars = function ($arg1, $arg2) use ($var1, $var2) {
    // body
};
```

Argument lists and variable lists MAY be split across multiple lines, where
each subsequent line is indented once. When doing so, the first item in the
list MUST be on the next line, and there MUST be only one argument or variable
per line.

When the ending list (whether or arguments or variables) is split across
multiple lines, the closing parenthesis and opening brace MUST be placed
together on their own line with one space between them.

The following are examples of closures with and without argument lists and
variable lists split across multiple lines.

```php
<?php
$longArgs_noVars = function (
    $longArgument,
    $longerArgument,
    $muchLongerArgument
) {
   // body
};

$noArgs_longVars = function () use (
    $longVar1,
    $longerVar2,
    $muchLongerVar3
) {
   // body
};

$longArgs_longVars = function (
    $longArgument,
    $longerArgument,
    $muchLongerArgument
) use (
    $longVar1,
    $longerVar2,
    $muchLongerVar3
) {
   // body
};

$longArgs_shortVars = function (
    $longArgument,
    $longerArgument,
    $muchLongerArgument
) use ($var1) {
   // body
};

$shortArgs_longVars = function ($arg) use (
    $longVar1,
    $longerVar2,
    $muchLongerVar3
) {
   // body
};
```

Note that the formatting rules also apply when the closure is used directly
in a function or method call as an argument.

```php
<?php
$foo->bar(
    $arg1,
    function ($arg2) use ($var1) {
        // body
    },
    $arg3
);
```

10. Comments and Documentation
------------------------------

Comments should begin with two backslashes, `//`, and end with a single period.
If a comment drifts too far past the line of code that it documents, wrap the comment
to the next line using an additional `//`.

```php
<?php

// Use the AuthService to login the user with their
// email and password.
$response = $authService->Login($email, $password);
```

Comments should never be used to document closing braces.

Documentation blocks for class methods or functions should use proper [PHPDoc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHPDoc) notation.

11. SQL Strings
------------------------------

SQL strings should always use double-quotes, and should always have a line break before and after the SQL string. The SQL should be formatted per the example below:

```sql
  SELECT
    fi.first,
    s.second,
    t.third_thing AS third,
    COUNT(fo.fourth) AS fourth_count
  FROM
    first AS fi
    JOIN second AS s ON s.first_id = fi.id
    JOIN third AS t ON t.second_id = s.id
    JOIN fourth AS fo ON fo.third_id = t.id
  WHERE
    fi.param = 1
    AND s.param = 3
    AND (
      f.param1 = 2
      OR f.param2 = 5
    )
  ORDER BY
    fo.ordered DESC,
    fi.ordered
```

Please note the capitalization of SQL reserved words, the use of AS, the indentation, and the line breaks.

12. Conclusion
--------------

There are many elements of style and practice intentionally omitted by this
guide. These include but are not limited to:

- Declaration of global variables and global constants

- Declaration of functions

- Operators and assignment

- Class name prefixes and suffixes

- Best practices

Future recommendations will revise and extend this guide to address those or
other elements of style and practice.
